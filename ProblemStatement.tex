\section*{Description}

Many restaurants are starting to incorporate new technology into their dining experience. ``All You Can Eat'' sushi restaurants have introduced tablets with their own application that allows you to order from their menu without even calling a server. However, there are few point of sales products on the market that offer a universal solution for multiple restaurants. We plan to make a product that allows users to create a singular account they can use to order from multiple dining establishments and pay for their order when they are finished.\\

	Restaurants have numerous times when they are at capacity or very busy, every day. Customers will be shown to their table and they will mostly be ready to order their food within the first 5 minutes but are stuck waiting for a waiter/waitress to take their order. Our app will allow users to sit down at a table, scan a QR code with their smartphone and the menu will be brought up on the app. From there, they can decide what they want to order, place their order with any special instructions and send in their order to the restaurant without having to call a server. This will allow dining establishments to streamline their front and back end services with minimal complications and errors. The food will be brought to their table, and when the customers are finished with their meal, they can choose to order more food or pay for their order with the app using their credit card.\\
	
	This will reduce the workload of the entire restaurant, especially the servers. We believe this app will thrive in this new market.
