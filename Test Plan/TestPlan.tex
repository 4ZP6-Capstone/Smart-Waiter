\section{Evaluation}

The following section first presents methods and constraints used during the evaluation process. This is followed by extent of testing and test tools to be used.

%4.1 Methods and Constraints
\subsection{ Methods and Constraints} 

%4.1.1 Methodology
\subsubsection{Methodology} 
Testing of Smart Waiter will consist of various types of tests explained in the next section. Manual testing will be conducted for the most part, some automation testing will be in place.

% 4.1.2 Extent of Testing
\subsubsection{Extent of Testing}
The extent of testing will be end to end for the final demonstration. For POC, specific system tests will be conducted.

% 4.1.3 Test Tools
\subsubsection{Test Tools}
To avoid regressions and catch bugs quickly two main test tools will be used. Namely the following;
\begin{itemize}
\item JUnit \textemdash Junit will be used to build an automation test suite for the application. Specifically, JUnit is a testing framework used to implement unit testing in Java. This tool will easily integrate into the android studio build environment used for application. In addition, it will help developers leverage their Java knowledge used during application development. 
\item CodeReviewer \textemdash CodeReviewer will be used for code review process mandatory for all developers. This tool helps post code reviews and provides features such as annotations, diff viewers, easy communication and feedback. This tool will be used for static tests to produce high quality code with less defects
 \end{itemize}

% 4.1.4 Testing Constraints
\subsubsection{ Testing Constraints}

\subsection{Types of Tests}

\subsubsection{Functional Testing}
Functional testing is in place to uncover errors that occur in implementing requirements or design specifications. Concentration is on results rather then the internals functions of the program. This type of testing is very effective to evaluate functional requirements.

\subsubsection{Structural Testing}
Structural testing is in place to uncover errors during implementation of the application. Concentration is on evaluating structure of the application. This type of testing focuses on non functional requirements.  

\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
Unit testing refers to providing specific input to a system and verifying it evaluates to expected output.This process can be done manually or automated.

\subsubsection{Manual and Automatic Testing}
Manual testing is done by people, while automatic is processed through scripts. 

\subsubsection{Static Testing}
Static testing refers to testing techniques that simulate a dynamic environment. This does not involve program execution. Instead, a walk-though through will be performed checking pre and post conditions evaluate to requirements specified. As well to make sure proper syntax is used thoroughly.This type of testing is crucial in design stage. \\
Static testing will be enforced through out the development process. A code review process will be put into place to strictly manage the quality of the code. Specifically, developers will have to sign off on the quality of the code before it gets checked into the production repo. The tool used for code reviews be Codereviewer. \\\\
Below we have highlighted the code review process;\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{review_process.png}\\\\
The reviewers will assess the code quality and critique the code in following criteria;\\
\begin{itemize}
 \item General Unit Testing performed. Did it pass?
 \item Comment and Coding Conventions followed consistently?
 \item Error Handling done correctly?
 \item Resource Leaks within the code?
 \item Is the code thread safe?
 \item Is the code up to standard with performance?
 \item Does code provide correct functionality?
 \item Is the code secure?
 \end{itemize}
The reviewers will assess the code and mark issues found with severity. If any of the high severity issues found, then developer must fix code. For medium severity issues, developer can provide reasoning and try to convince reviewers. Low severity issues can possibly be dropped if they are nits. The reviewers will mark severity as follows;
\begin{itemize}
\item Naming Conventions and Coding style considered low severity
\item Control flow and Logical issues considered medium or high severity
\item Redundant Code considered medium or high severity
\item Performance Issues considered high severity
\item Security Issues considered high severity
\item Scalability Issues considered medium or high severity
\item Functional Issues considered high severity
\item Error Handling considered high severity
\item Reusability considered medium severity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Testing}
On the contrary, dynamic testing refers to executing the program while running test cases to view expected behaviour. This is done to find and fix defects in the program. This will be performed after implementation phase. All of the tests performed in the following sections are dynamic. Specifically, different techniques are used to perform this testing such as automated and manual test cases. However, due to the nature of the application all other testing will be dynamic since the values are all dynamic.

\section{POC System Test Description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
						%database design %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Database Testing}
Database testing is exclusively performed from structural testing point of view. The goal of this component of testing is to verify that the database queries always return valid and correct data, under all circumstances. Specifically, a separate database will be created for testing purposes, because any failed test case should not affect the state of the original database. 
\subsubsection{Test Factors}
For database testing, the following test factors will be considered;
\begin{itemize}
 \item Correctness
 \item Performance
 \item Security
 \item Reliability
 \end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{Correctness}
In this section of database testing, tester must verify that the application receives complete and correct data from the couchbase server. Automated unit tests will be written using JUnit to perform the following tests.
\subsubsection{Database Correctness Automated Tests }
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{correctness_tests.png}

\subsubsection{Performance}
In this section of database testing, tester must verify that the data query is performed in a reasonable amount of time. The application should have a maximum loading period of 5 seconds to complete data queries. Moreover, considering the customer base and size of database our application, none of the following test cases should take more than 5 seconds.
\subsubsection{Database Performance Automated Tests }
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{performance_tests.png}

\subsubsection{Security}
In this section of database query testing, tester must verify that database allows correct access control. Database penetration testing is not required because we will leverage couchbase security implementation, testing and certifications.
\subsubsection{Database Security Automated Tests }
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Security_tests.png}

\subsubsection{Reliability}
In this section of database testing, we will test the robustness and reliability of the database.  This type of testing is essential the health of the database system. There should be no failures or downtimes on the backend side.
